<p align="center">
<b>NOTE</b>: Traverse for 1.19.4 no longer packages TerraBlender, which is now available from Modrinth as well as CurseForge. It is strongly recommended to download and use <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/terrablender">TerraBlender</a>, as Biolith worldgen is EXPERIMENTAL.
</p>

<p align="center">
Traverse aims to expand upon, but not replace or overshadow, Minecraft biomes. Traverse embraces the simplistic nature of many vanilla biomes and the goal is to have the biomes fit in just right so that Mojang could add them into the base game and nobody would complain that they felt out of place.

Traverse requires <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/">Fabric Loader</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api">Fabric API</a> and the latest 1.18.2 version requires <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrablender-fabric">Terrablender</a>

#### Other Mods by Terraformers:
<p align="center">
	<strong>Check out Traverse's sister mod, <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria">Terrestria</a>:</strong></br>
	<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria"><img title="Terrestria" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/mAviXA0.png"></a></br>
	Terrestria works well alongside Traverse if you are looking for a more extensive biome enhancement experience. Terrestria has a lot of highly unique and detailed biomes that may exceed the "Vanilla+" category that Traverse fits into.
